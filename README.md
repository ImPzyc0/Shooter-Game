Start the game, shoot around! 
As this is to show my previous coding experience, the unecessary (and large) unity project is not fully uploaded. 
Furthermore to the description, this project uses my self-made gunmodels, animations done in the unity editor, a sniper with a 
scope that zoomes in via a 2nd camera, multiple weapons including the sniper and a shotgun that are fully functional.
The guns are broken down into a lot of different super classes, and the methods of those are just called in the final class, making 
it really modular and reusable. It has bug free recoil. As there is no good youtube tutorial on recoil, I made it all myself:
Random recoil that goes mostly up like in Apex Legends when zooming in, predictable recoil when hip firing like in Valorant, where there is
just a little bloom and a high first bullet accuracy. It is also works with low and high fps and is always the same (Damn you youtube tutorial with 150 thousand
clicks where I was the only one who noticed the mathematical inaccuracy that made it useless) under the same circumstances.
It also has bloom (like fortnite) that is dependent on the amount of movement coming from the player, and if the player is jumping. 
A little physics and movement code is also present, aswell as code for mouse input and movement, using the Unity CharacterController. 

The code is my own, but I learned it from an endless amount of youtube tutorials on many things, and multiple previous Unity projects. 
It is above the level of any youtube tutorials I was able to find on it.
With the exception of the network code that I started (which is very, very little of the total project), it is 0% AI.
